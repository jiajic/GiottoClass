#' @name overlapPointDT-class
#' @title Polygon and Point Relationships
#' @description
#' Utility class for storing overlaps relationships between polygons and points
#' in a sparse `data.table` format. Retrieve the unique ID index of overlapped
#' points `[i, ]`. Get indices of which polys are overlapping specific feature
#' species using `[, j]`.
#'
#' Subsetting with `ids = FALSE` and `[i, j]` indexing is also supported.
#'
#' Supports `as.matrix` for conversion to `dgCMatrix`. Contained poly and
#' feature names simplify rownames/colnames and empty row/col creation.
#'
#' @slot data data.table. Table containing 3 integer cols:
#'
#'   * `poly` - polygon index. Maps to `spat_ids` slot.
#'   * `feat` - feat_ID_uniq (unique integer identifier) of a point detection
#'   * `feat_id_index` - index of feature name mapping in `@feat_ids` slot.
#' @slot spat_unit character. Spatial unit (usually name of polygons information)
#' @slot feat_type character. Feature type (usually name of points information)
#' @slot provenance character. provenance information
#' @slot spat_ids character. Polygon names
#' @slot feat_ids character. Feature names
#' @slot nfeats integer (optional metadata). How many feature points were
#'  used in overlap operation. Gives an idea of sparsity, but has no effect on
#'  processing.
#'
#' @param x object
#' @param i numeric, character, logical. Index of or name of poly in overlapping
#' polygons
#' @param j numeric, character, logical. Index of or name of feature being
#' overlapped.
#' @param use_names logical (default = `FALSE`). Whether to return as integer
#' indices or with character ids.
#' @param ids logical (default = `TRUE`). Whether to return the requested
#' integer indices (`TRUE`) or the subset overlap object (`FALSE`).
#' @param drop not used.
#' @param \dots additional params to pass (none implemented)
#' @returns integer or character if only `i` or `j` provided, depending on
#' `use_names`. A subset `overlapPointDT` if both `i` and `j` are used.
